# ESC_Websitev4
Engineering Student Council's GitHub repo for the website. This is currently the working version of the website. For the sake of editing,
Version will no longer be updated unless the website UI/UX changes. A final push request will show the updated website before the design/user experience changed.

## Why create this version:
_Engineering Student Council at Berkeley was going through a structure change. As shown in other versions of the website, we solely focused on providing support for 
ESC affiliated organizations. This was due to the belief that the ESC supports the Engineering community through direct support of engineering organizations. After 2019, we are changing the ESC model to directly impact the 
student body. Thus, our website shifted to include more about who we are, projects we are working/had worked on, and guides for students and organizations._

## Benefits of this website:
- User friendly website design
- Student section (with guides and resources)
- More information for student organizations (how to affiliate with the ESC, tips on booking rooms)

## Downsides of this website:
- Updating the website (especially the header)
